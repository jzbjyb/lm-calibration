<div><div>learning to live with the laws of motion freed from the grip of earth's gravity, astronauts find themselves in a living physics textbook. russian cosmonaut yuri gagarin, during his pioneering first orbit of the earth in 1961, was the first to experience the practical effects. he put down his pencil while writing out his log. obeying newton's first law-the same principle of uniform motion that keeps the planets moving around the sun-the pencil floated out of reach: gagarin had to complete his log by speaking into a tape recorder. nowadays astronauts keep equipment in place with velcroÂ® or bungee straps. newton's second law states that force is needed to accelerate or decelerate a body. in practice this means astronauts must learn how to push themselves carefully through their spacecraft, or else they will simply float around helplessly. and once astronauts get moving they have to remember to stop themselves as they near where they want to be. otherwise they'll keep going until they hit something-or someone. first-timers tend to collect a lot of bruises. newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. this, too, has very apparent consequences for astronauts: if they so much as try to turn a screw without anchoring themselves to a wall, they'll find themselves twisting instead. the reaction from even the mildest of actions- typing at a computer keyboard, say-will send an astronaut floating away. it's not that the laws of motion are any different on earth than in space. but earth's gravitational field has such an overwhelming force it masks their precise effects. and gravity is integral to all sorts of phenomena that we take for granted. for example, the air in our homes circulates naturally: hot air rises because it is lighter than cool air, and convection currents form. in orbit, nothing is lighter than anything else, so ordinary convection currents can't exist. without a ventilation fan, sleeping astronauts would suffocate in the carbon dioxide that accumulated around their faces. similarly, weightless flames behave very differently from their earth-bound counterparts. instead of a flickering column of hot gas, a flame in orbit is a small blue</div><div>-0.8258319385898429 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 44%, 100%); ' title='-10.0625'>move</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 81%, 100%); ' title='-3.40625'>in</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 89%, 100%); ' title='-1.984375'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 92%, 100%); ' title='-1.429688'>same</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.09375'>direction</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 80%, 100%); ' title='-3.78125'>but</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 94%, 100%); ' title='-1.15625'>at</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 97%, 100%); ' title='-0.671875'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 81%, 100%); ' title='-3.375'>faster</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 98%, 100%); ' title='-0.46875'>speed</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 98%, 100%); ' title='-0.4375'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>read the article below and answer the question. spiders have been around for over 400 million years. early spiders mainly used their silk to construct a hiding place. today, although many spiders-such as giant tarantulas, trap-door spiders, and some other species-still use their silk mainly for shelter, most build various types of aerial webs. the primary victims of the spider's web are insects-a lot of insects. a british researcher once calculated that local farmland was home to more than two million spiders per acre, and that insects eaten annually by spiders nationwide would outweigh the human population. in fact, the change from ground-based webs to vertical, aerial webs was a reaction to the rise of winged insects. the increase in spiders in so many places is mainly because of their ability to move. to travel, a spider goes to a high point, lets out enough silk to catch the wind, and floats away. the spider may travel many miles this way. this helps them distance themselves from other spiders competing for food and also aids them in spinning a web across a gap they would otherwise have trouble crossing. spiders release silk from silk glands called spigots to weave their webs. hundreds of these spigots cover the three pairs of spinnerets that most spiders have. this allows spiders to combine multiple strands of silk into single threads with characteristics that differ for different uses. some spiders, like tarantulas, only make one type of silk, but others make silk to use for drag lines, web frames, egg cases, or to trap insects. the webs also help spiders hide from predators such as birds. other animals also make use of the spider's web. a hymenoepimecis wasp will attack a plesiometa argyra spider and sting it. while the spider is paralyzed, the wasp deposits her egg on the spider's abdomen. the spider goes about its business, catching and eating prey, while the wasp larva feeds on the spider's blood. source: national geographic, august 2001, pp. 32-44 the most likely reason that spiders benefited from building vertical webs is (a)</div><div>-0.7099275466043273 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 85%, 100%); ' title='-2.984375'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 86%, 100%); ' title='-2.484375'>avoid</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 69%, 100%); ' title='-5.71875'>other</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.09375'>spider</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>s</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 78%, 100%); ' title='-3.90625'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>what is the subject discussed in the text? (a) effects of stressful condition. (b) kinds of social support. (c) ways to deal with stress. (d) interpersonal relationships. since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal relationships. one strength of the human condition is our possibility to give and receive support from one another under stressful conditions. social support makes up of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. those of us with strong support systems appear better able to deal with major life changes and daily problems. people with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties. studies over types of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, show that the presence of social support helps people defend themselves against illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely. social support cushions stress in a number of ways. first, friends, relatives and co-workers may let us know that they value us. our self-respect is strengthened when we feel accepted by others in spite of our faults and difficulties. second, other people often provide us with informational support. they help us to define and understand our problems and find solutions to them. third, we typically find social companionship supportive. taking part in free-time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distracting us from our worries and troubles. finally, other people may give us instrumental support money aid, material resources, and needed services - that reduces stress by helping us resolve and deal with our problems.</div><div>-0.42875931297729275 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.1875'>kinds</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>of</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>social</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>support</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>what does the passage mainly talk about? (a) forest plants. (b) animal doctors. (c) chimp's diets. (d) a cure for cancer. the chimp didn't feel well. she fell over, ignoring the other wild chimps. finally, the sick chimp crawled over to a bush, picked some leaves and swallowed them. by the next afternoon, the chimp was as good as new! biologists watching the chimp were surprised. somehow, the plant had cured the chimp! did the chimp know the plant would make her feel better? or was it just a lucky accident? many scientists don't think it has anything to do with luck. they're discovering that some animals seem to use plants to cure themselves. and these animals are leading scientists to new plants that could cure humans! dr. richard wrangham, an anthropologist at harvard university, agrees that animals may know something we don't know about forest plants. wrangham got to know chimps and their diets while studying them for three years in tanzania. "you must know a lot about an animal's feeding habits to know what it doesn't consider food," wrangham explains. every morning, he saw that most chimps ate fruit near their nests. later on, they ate on leaves. when he noticed chimps eating the leaves of a plant they usually ignored, wrangham thought something interesting was going on---especially when he saw that they'd sometimes walk for 20 minutes to find the plant. another strange thing that caught his eye was how they ate the bitter leaves. "they swallowed the leaves whole," explains wrangham, noting that chimps usually chew their food well. "they seemed to rub the leaves around the roofs of their mouths. they closed their eyes, wrinkled their noses and swallowed slowly. " wrangham wondered what could be so good about something tasting so bad. he had a chemist analyze the leaves. he discovered that the leaves contain a red oil that kills different viruses . later tests showed that the oil might even fight cancer and the aids virus! why don't</div><div>-0.41073022087389455 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.117188'>forest</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>plants</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"a species tends to grow bigger when it reaches the peak of its population , but becomes smaller when numbers decline," he said. the dental remains of the skull, which is the oldest giant panda skull ever found, are similar to today's pandas, indicating the type of teeth that could munch mountains of bamboo. a panda can eat up to 40kg of bamboo per day. paleoanthropologist russell ciochon, the us co-author at the university of lowa, said the panda's focus on bamboo could have helped it survive all these years.

" his stepmother's words warmed his heart, his eyes full of tears. with this, he started building friendship with his stepmother. and this became the drive of his life, making him create 28 successful golden rules, which helped tens of thousands of ordinary people walk on the road to success. before his stepmother came, no one praised him smart, and his father and neighbors considered him as a bad boy. however, his stepmother's words changed his life. when hill was 14 years old, his stepmother bought him a used typewriter and said to him, "i believe you will become a writer." hill accepted his stepmother's gift and expectation, and started writing things to a local newspaper. he understood his stepmother's strong feeling of interest in his family while he saw with his own eyes she had changed his family. therefore, he would do as well as she expected him to. the strength from his stepmother made him a rich man and famous writer in the united states and one of the most important persons in the 20th century. praise will never be unnecessary, especially for children. a sincere (> praise may be better than 10, 000 bad words.</div><div>-0.39107245235391863 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'>foolish</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>the best title of the passage should be _ . (a) flower gardens in holland (b) comfort or growth (c) personal development (d) the topping approach a at a recent visit to the beautiful keukenhof flower gardens in holland, i learned about the practice of topping.as flowers grow, sometimes the growers cut off the tops of the flowers, which they believe causes the plants to invest more energy into flower growth and less into seed production.the expected result is flower buds that will produce higher quality flowers. this is the same with personal growth.sometimes when we produce first results in a certain area, it can be helpful to cut them off and throw them away.this can free up energy for a stronger attempt elsewhere instead of settling into the comfort zone of satisfaction with the old results. after running my computer games business for 10 years and getting satisfying results with it, i decided to drop it and leave that field behind.this freed up my energy to focus on my personal development writing and speaking.if i'd kept running the old business, this would have meant less energy to invest in my new path. it can be difficult to choose the topping approach because you're taking something that's already reasonably satisfying and cutting it out of your life, in the hopes that something even better will grow in its place. do you want to settle where you are right now? if so, then topping is unnecessary.but if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.to free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.this gives you a shot at the truly beautiful. stepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, i do find it to be the more beautiful path.</div><div>-0.38999477723604425 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>topping</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>approach</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>what is the author's attitude about lava mae's development? (a) positive. (b) negative. (c) objective. (d) uncertain. according to the most recent count, more than 6,500 homeless people sleep on the street or in shelters in san francisco, and there are only eight shower facilities specifically available to the homeless, and most of these have just one or two stalls and aren't open every day. now san francisco-based company lava mae, is trying to change that with a simple but smart idea--turning retired city buses into mobile showers for the homeless. the idea known as lava mae, is a response to the need of the homeless in the city. it all started two years ago when sandoval got in a cab after a meeting in the soma district of san francisco, where the homeless mainly lived. "my driver turned around and said, 'welcome to the land of broken dreams.' " then sandoval awoke from her imagination and started really look at the people around her. " a woman i passed was crying and saying that she would never be clean", sandoval said. she took what the woman said as a sign that she should focus on the problem of hygiene , one of the most pressing needs for the homeless. after doing some research, sandoval hit on the idea of a mobile unit that could be equipped with shower facilities. according to the company's founder doniece sandoval, every bus will be renewed and equipped with two separate private areas, each with a shower stall, sink, changing areas, toilet and bench. sandoval says that if everyone sticks to a five-minute shower, a single lava mae bus could provide service for about 100 people during each 8- to 10-hour shift. the project has been several years in the making as it has not been easy to get officials to agree. in addition, it is also difficult to ask the bus company to donate buses. now she has reached an agreement with a bus company, which will donate the buses being retired in the next four years. while lava mae is now focused on the city of san francisco, there is no reason that the</div><div>-0.3878102258005294 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.140625'>objective</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"i have an idea." he said. "what is your idea?" asked the donkeys. "i will paint you and no one will know you are donkeys," said the man. the man went off to find some paint and he returned in just a matter of minutes. he had two pots of paint. one pot was filled with white paint, and the other black paint. the old man first painted them white, and then painted black stripes over the white paint. when he finished, the donkeys did not look at all like donkeys. "you no longer look like donkeys, " the old man said. " everyone will be fooled. i will call you something else, zebras.

<div><div>what may not affect the adult readers' vocabulary scores? (a) the contents of reading. (b) the design of the page. (c) versions online or not. (d) the frequency of reading. children who read for pleasure at the age of 10 have far higher vocabulary scores by the age of 42. researchers at the institute of education(ioe)have found that the most crazy childhood readers score far higher on vocabulary tests 30 years later.the new study suggests that children who read for pleasure carry the intellectual benefits with them far into adulthood. "the long-term influence of reading for pleasure on vocabulary that we have identified may be because the frequent childhood readers continued to read throughout their twenties and thirties,"says lead author professor alice sullivan at the ioe.researchers followed 9,400 british people from the age of 10 up to 42.their vocabulary was tested using a simple quiz which asked participants to match up words to the most similar meaning. those who had regularly read for pleasure at 10 scored 67 percent at the age of 42,while infrequent childhood readers scored only 51 percent. the ioe study also found that what people chose to read as adults mattered as much as how often they read.the greatest improvements between ages 16 and 42 were made by readers of 'elegant' fictions such as booker prize winning novels.and they found that readers of quality newspapers,including online versions,made more progress in vocabulary throughout their lives than those who read _ . in addition,generally speaking,the adult readers who especially read broadsheets scored 76 percent on the assessment compared to 57 percent amongst those who didn't.</div><div>-0.3818004360864169 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.15625'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.015625'>design</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>of</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>page</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"we'd be driving around in the car and she would recite her bedtime stories from the night before. she didn't just recite them, and she recited them exactly." alexis' father would try to trick her and say that her story went a different way, but she always corrected him. most 12-month-old children take their first steps on their own and most 18-month-olds can only name a small number of objects and body parts, and follow simple two-step questions. even though alexis is a genius , her parents are faced with lots of challenges like how to teach her to make friends of her own age.

<div><div>which of the following is not true? (a) bruce and edison were successful examples. (b) failure may be regarded as a way toward success. (c) edison learned a lot from the lesson the spider taught robert bruce. (d) one may often raise a question whether his goals are worth attempting. in one way of thinking, failure is a part of life. in another way, failure may be a way towards success. the "spider story" is often told. robert bruce, leader of the scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the english. he watched a spider spinning a web . the spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. he tried six times without success. on the seventh time he _ and went on to spin his web. bruce is said to have taken heart and to have gone on to defeat the english... edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. so what? first, always think about your failure. what caused it? were conditions right? were you in top from yourself? what can you change so things will go right next time? second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. think about his question, "if i do succeed in this, where will it get me?" this may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway. the third thing to bear in mind about failure is that it's a part of life. learn to "live with yourself" even though you may have failed. remember, "you can't win them all."</div><div>0.37694149613246863 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-0.03125'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 88%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-2.4375'>e</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>d</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>i</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>son</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>learned</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>lot</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>from</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-0.0625'>lesson</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>spider</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>taught</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>rob</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>er</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>t</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>bru</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>ce</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>what was the speed of the first flight? (a) 10 feet per second. (b) 120 feet per minute. (c) 12 feet per second. (d) 1200 feet per hour. at 10:35 a.m. on december 17, 1903, two brothers from ohio flew the first successful airplane for 12 seconds and 120 feet along a beach in kitty hawk, north carolina. with orville flying first, the brothers took turns as pilot, and they flew three more times that day. on their fourth try, they managed to go 852 feet in 59 seconds ----an amazing feat at the time. the two brothers had invented powered flight. orville and wilbur wright owned a bicycle shop in dayton, ohio. although they had not gone to school to learn about airplanes or engineering, they were good mechanics. by repairing bicycles, they had learned how gears and pulleys worked. they also learned to take careful notes about what they saw. each time they made a new design and tested a machine, they took notes and made drawings. they would study these to figure out what they could do better the next time. before the wright brothers flew, they did many things to prepare for this extraordinary achievement. they read everything they could find about air, balloons, and kites. then they made careful sketches of what they wanted to build. they began by making model kites to learn how air flowed over wings. they made them bigger and bigger until they had a glider -- a kite that is big enough to hold a person, but with no engine. the wright brothers made three gliders before building their first airplane. each time they made a glider, they would test it, make careful observations, and then improve their design. when they made a glider that flew well, they added an engine. this step was harder than it sounds, because they had to find an engine that was both light-weight and powerful. the engines that they could buy were either too heavy or too weak, so they asked their friend charlie taylor to help them build one. the first engine that charlie built broke almost immediately, but the second one worked well. after orville and wilbur installed the engine</div><div>-0.37419668491001257 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'>12</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>feet</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>per</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>second</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>this passage is most probably taken from _ . (a) a dentist's diary (b) a sports newspaper (c) a medicine magazine (d) a science report professional footballers have worryingly poor teeth that could be affecting their performance on the football ground, say dentists. their study on players at eight clubs in england and wales, in the british journal o f sports medicine, showed nearly 4 out of 10 had cavities and that athletes often had worse teeth than the general population. regularly taking sugary foods is one possible explanation. the dentists, from the international centre for evidence-based oral health at university college london, examined 187 players' sets of teeth. they found 53% had dental erosion , 45% were bothered by the state of their teeth and 7% said it affected their ability to train or play. around 40% had cavities, compared with 30% of people of a similar age in the general population. prof ian needleman, one of the researchers, said: "these are individuals who otherwise invest so much in themselves so it's a surprising finding. "there are two main groups - some have a catastrophic effect, they have very serious disease that stops them in their tracks and they cannot play or train. "there il be others experiencing pain affecting sleep or sensitivity every time they take a drink. " at this level of athlete, even small differences can be quite telling. nutrition is one of the primary suspects with having too many sugary or acidic foods during training potentially accounting for cavities and erosion. a lot of air in the mouth during exercise can also dry it out so there is less protection. while these findings are worrying, clubs are attaching greater importance to dental health and educating their players. according to stijin vandenbroucke, head of medicine and sports science at west ham united, oral health is an area where many athletes have greater problems than the general population and there are clear benefits of oral disease prevention for athletes and clubs.</div><div>-0.3734770501319976 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.15625'>science</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>report</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>the passage mainly aims to _ . (a) promote ethical destinations (b) encourage ecotourism trips (c) speed up the development of tourism (d) discuss which countries are ethical destinations tourism has the power to bring jobs and economic development to popular destination , but how should travelers decide where to spend their money? are some countries more deserving of visitors' dollars than others? that's the idea behind the 10-destination list put together by san francisco-based non-profit ethical traveler, which since 2006,has published an annual guide to the world's best ethical destinations in the developing world. "instead of publishing countries for doing bad things," said jeff greenwald, executive director of ethical traveler, "we're trying to offer a favor, rewarding countries in the developing world that are really trying to do the right thing." so which countries are the most ethical? for 2013,the winners are barbados, cape verde, costa rica, ghana, latvia ,lithuania, mauritius, palau, samoa and uruguay. those 10 countries scored highest in three main areas: social welfare, environmental protection and human rights. greenwald explained that countries must have a good tourism infrastructure to make the list, but the non-profit ethical traveler also uses the list to promote some under-visited places that can be a role model for other countries in their region. for example, latvia earned high marks for improving its environmental efforts and strong human rights record, and the country's parks and nature reserves make for a great off-the-beaten-path ecotourism trip. in addition to just visiting these countries, travelers should aim to spend their money in locally-owned business, greenwald said, to ensure their financial support stays in the country they're visiting. however, that requires a well-maneged tourism infrastructure. while one could argue those poor places need the money even more, tourism can put pressure on countries that face such challenges. erica avrami, research and education director at the world monuments fund(wmf) said that a list of ethical destinations is "a wonderful idea", the idea of being ethical goes both ways. "there's also a certain responsibility on the part of the traveler to make sure their own footprint is as minimal as</div><div>-0.3711464140553242 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.15625'>discuss</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>which</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>countries</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>are</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>ethical</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>destinations</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>what is the tradition of lighting candles for birthdays like in europe? (a) the candles were always kept burning all day on a person's birthday. (b) the blowing out of candles represented one's prayers to the god. (c) some cultures believe it is right to blow out the candles before the evening meal. (d) the europeans sometimes keep burning the candles all day just as a celebration. [:zxxk.com] when a cake is brought to the table at a birthday party, it is usually decorated with candles. it is said that the tradition of lighting birthday candles was invented by the ancient greeks; it has taken on different meanings through the years. today, one of the most popular birthday traditions is to blow out the candles all at once to make a secret wish come true. in order to please artemis, the goddess of the moon, the ancient greeks arranged something special for birthdays. a moon-shaped cake was baked and decorated with lit candles. they thought the smoke from the candles would carry an offering up into the sky, where they believed artemis lived. the tradition of lighting birthday candles continued in europe, where candles were sometimes kept burning all day on a person's birthday, partly as celebration and partly to keep away evil spirits. it was believed that the blowing out of candles represented one's prayers to the gods. some cultures believe it is a bad luck to blow out the candles until after the evening meal is eaten. traditionally, one candle represents a year of the person's age. some families prefer to add an extra candle for good luck. but that practice is improper when a very young child is celebrating a third birthday. generally, older people's birthdays are celebrated by placing just a few candles to represent, such as an eight for 80th birthday. today's birthday candles are made in different shapes, like animals or flowers. one or two candles in the shape of numbers are sometimes used instead of lots of candles; for example, a four-shaped and a zero-shaped candle would represent 40.</div><div>-0.37052450062138387 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 95%, 100%); ' title='-0.84375'>some</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>cultures</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>believe</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>it</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>is</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>right</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>blow</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>out</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>candles</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>before</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>evening</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>meal</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>helping a sick neighbor with some repair work in spare time is an example of _ (a) instrumental support (b) informational support (c) social companionship (d) the strengthening of self-respect since we are social beings, the quality of our lives depends in large measure on our interpersonal relationships. one strength of the human condition is our possibility to give and receive support from one another under stressful conditions. social support makes up of the exchange of resources among people based on their interpersonal ties. those of us with strong support systems appear better able to deal with major life changes and daily problems. people with strong social ties live longer and have better health than those without such ties. studies over types of illnesses, from depression to heart disease, show that the presence of social support helps people defend themselves against illness, and the absence of such support makes poor health more likely. social support cushions stress in a number of ways. first, friends, relatives and co-workers may let us know that they value us. our self-respect is strengthened when we feel accepted by others in spite of our faults and difficulties. second, other people often provide us with informational support. they help us to define and understand our problems and find solutions to them. third, we typically find social companionship supportive. taking part in free-time activities with others helps us to meet our social needs while at the same time distracting us from our worries and troubles. finally, other people may give us instrumental support money aid, material resources, and needed services - that reduces stress by helping us resolve and deal with our problems.</div><div>-0.37037436184919803 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'>instrumental</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>support</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"who put this stone in the center of the road?" said the old man, but he didn't try to move the stone away. he passed around the stone with some difficulties and continued on his way. another man came along and did the same thing; then another came,and another. all of them complained about the stone in the center of the road,but nobody tried to move it. late in the afternoon,a young man came along. he saw the stone and said, "it will be dark at night. some people will come along later in the dark and will fall over the stone and get hurt." the young man then began to move the stone. he pushed and pulled and tried everything he could to move it out of the road. but to his surprise, under the stone he found a bag full of money and this message, "this money is for the person who moves this stone from the road. the person deserves help."</div><div>-0.36887372982641553 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>young</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>man</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>was</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>lucky</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>
<div><div>in the article "back off" means_. (a) to escape from the attackers (b) to get away quickly (c) to keep out the attackers (d) to avoid the attackers in words body language is a very powerful tool of a communication, not only between people but in the animal world as well. in many instances, we produce idioms which are all understandable by borrowing examples from animal communication. for example, we know that a frightened cat will arch . from this starting-point we might hear the expression. "he gets my back up!" meaning "he makes me angry." in the same manner, we know that many animals, if challenged by attackers, will not turn and run away because this will encourage the attackers to attack them more forcefully. instead, they will move backwards slowly to get out of harm's way, always facing their attacker. we call this action "backing off" and it can be used as well with humans as with animals. in the case of humans, however, the back-off may not be physical but oral, as in using a kinder tone of voice and gentle words instead of fighting against the attackers.</div><div>-0.3688088686085037 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.09375'>avoid</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>attacker</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>s</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 95%, 100%); ' title='-0.890625'>in</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>words</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>which of the following best describes the author's attitude to uncertainty and confusion? (a) favorable. (b) resistant. (c) curious. (d) doubtful. most people i meet want to develop more harmonious and satisfying relationships. but we may not realize that this can only be achieved by partnering with two new and strange allies : uncertainty and confusion. most of us aren't trained to like confusion or to admit we feel hesitant and uncertain. in our schools and organizations, we place value on sounding certain and confident. as life continues to speed up, i believe our changing world requires less certainty and far more curiosity. i'm not suggesting we let go of our beliefs, but that we become curious about what someone else believes. as we become open to the disturbing differences, sometimes we discover that another's way of interpreting the world is actually essential to our survival. for me, the first step in becoming curious is to admit that i'm not succeeding in figuring things out by myself. if my solutions don't work as well as i'd like, i take these as signs that it's time to begin asking others what they think. i try to become a conscious listener, actively listening for differences. there are many ways to listen for differences. lately, i've been listening for what surprises me. this isn't easy -- i'm accustomed to sitting there, nodding my head as someone voices his opinions. but when i notice what surprises me, i'm able to see my own views more clearly, including my assumptions. if you're willing to be disturbed and confused, i recommend you begin a conversation with someone who thinks differently from you. listen for what's different and what surprises you. try to stop the voice of judgment or opinion and just listen. at the end, notice whether you've learned something new. we have the opportunity many times a day to be the one who listens to others and the one who is curious rather than certain. when we listen with fewer judgments, we always develop better relationships with each other. _ . curiosity and good listening bring us back together. as i consider partnering with confusion and uncertainty, i'm learning that we don't have to agree with each other in order to think well together. there is no need for us to</div><div>-0.3669751617474768 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'>curious</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"they're my foundation," says kristiana st.john, 17, a high-school student from queens in new york. "my mom tells me that even if i do something stupid, she's still going to love me no matter what. just knowing that makes me feel very happy and blessed." you might think money would be clearly tied to a general sense of happiness. but almost no one says "money" when asked what makes them happy, though people with the highest family incomes are generally happier with life. however, having highly educated parents is a stronger predictor of happiness than income. from the body to the soul: close to half say religion and spirituality are very important. and more than half say they believe there is a higher power that has an influence over things that make them happy. beyond religion, simply belonging to an organized religious group makes people happier. and parents, here's some more for you: most young people in school say it makes them happy. overwhelmingly , young people think marriage would make them happy and want to be married some day. most also want to have kids. finally, when asked to name their heroes, nearly half of respondents mentioned one or both of their parents. the winner, by a nose: mom.</div><div>-0.3640671195372236 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.03125'>stay</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>with</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>parents</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>to report the american gnp, the government should not consider goods and services produced _ . (a) by american companies at home (b) by american companies in china (c) by american companies in singapore (d) by japanese companies in the united states governments all over the world make public reports about the condition of their economies. most countries, including the united states, have used a measure called the gross national product or gnp. it includes all goods and services produced by citizens of the country anywhere in the world. recently the american commerce department has started using a new method to measure production. it is known as the gross domestic product or gdp. it counts only goods and services that have been produced within the nation's borders. money earned by foreign companies operating in the united states is included in the gdp, but money earned by american companies operating in other countries is not. economic experts generally approve of the change. they say that the gross domestic product provides a truer measure of the economy. they also note that most other industrial countries use this method. therefore it will be easier to study the economies of different countries. some officials also hope the new system will help them make better economic policy decisions. it will provide them with a clearer understanding of economic activity in the u.s. . the new measure is less likely to be affected by sudden changes in foreign oil prices or in the value of the american dollar in other countries. economic experts believe that the change from gnp to gdp will immediately reduce the value of american production by at least 40,000 million dollars a year. but that is really a very small change in the american economy - less than 1% . the commerce department reports the unofficial gross domestic product once every three months. the government also continues to report gnp as it has four times a year since 1941.</div><div>-0.3608696528661067 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>by</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>american</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>companies</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>in</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'>china</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

(c) he loves to make a comment on woman.

"dianhua"- telephone. after that, i begin hearing other words. sometimes, i would hear a couple of words in one sentence. more and more words began to stand out to me. i started studying chinese characters and began to be able to read small blocks of text in the advertisements. when i really began speaking in chinese to chinese people i met, i began to learn chinese fast and the smiles that i received in return were a fantastic reward for the work that i had done in learning the language. it was a great feeling</div><div>0.3606539084872 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>he</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 86%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-2.46875'>can</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>speak</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>flu</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>ent</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>chi</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>nes</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>e</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>when</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>ordering</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>meals</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>at</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>last</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>it's hard for bats to catch butterflies because butterflies fly _ . (a) much faster than bats (b) aimlessly (c) at different speeds (d) in a zigzag way there are about 15,000--20,000 species of butterflies all over the world.they can be found on every continent except antarctica. to go to sleep,butterflies look for a safe place like the underside of a leaf or a branch,for example.most butterflies sleep alone,but there are also species sleeping in groups.poisonous butterflies have a particular smell that probably protects them better when they sleep together.it is also useful not to change the group's sleeping place because a predator who attacked a poisonous butterfly one time won't do this again.there is only a limited number of predators in an area so there is only a limited number to" educate" if the sleeping place stays the same. one species from costa rica whose scientific name is marpesia berania sleeps in groups on a leaf.if one butterfly of the group is disturbed,it opens its wings and touches its neighbors.being touched,they open their wings as well and so the whole group is informed about the danger and can escape together. the speed of their flight depends on the way the butterfly flies:blues and whites normally have speeds under 8 km/h,the speed of fritillaries is between 16 to 40 km/h and some skippers reach speeds up to 60 km/h. besides warning and scaring predators with color1s butterflies fly in a special way.the direction of their amazing flight is hard to predict.when they hear the sounds of a bat,the ones flying at night start a zigzag flight in all directions:up and down,left and right.so it gets hard for the bat to catch them. in the dark when color1s don't function,some poisonous butterflies make clicking noises to warn bats that they are poisonous.of course other species copy this sound to produce the protective effect,too.</div><div>-0.3554317641481948 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.171875'>aim</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>lessly</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"when is it proper? when is it rude? some people see a gift of money as a sign of a gift-giver who is too lazy to go out and find a proper gift. however, this is not always the case. sometimes money is more appreciated than a gift that the receiver does not need or cannot use.</div><div>-0.3511061281004376 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.1875'>one</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>should</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>be</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>given</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>anyway</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>it can be inferred that a korean studying in the us is likely to _ . (a) use a picture of his face on facebook (b) adjust to american preferences quickly (c) change his profile photos from time to time (d) put up a photo of his apartment on facebook for millions of facebook users, choosing which photo to use for an online profile is an important decision. according to a study by researchers at the ut dallas center, the photos we select may reflect individual preferences, but they also appear to reflect more deeply rooted, unconscious cultural differences. previous research has shown that culture can affect not only language and custom, but also how we experience the world and process information. western cultures,for example,condition people to think of themselves as highly independent entities ( ),whereas east asian cultures stress collectivism and interdependence. dr. denise park, co-director of the center at ut dallas, and former graduate student dr. chihmao huang of the university of illinois, were curious about whether these patterns of cultural influence extend to cyberspace. in a paper published in the international journal of psychology, they examined the profile photographs of more than 500 active facebook users from the united states and east asia. overall, they found that profile photos of americans are more likely to focus on the individual's face,while the profiles of east asians tend to less emphasize the face and include more background features. americans also show greater smile intensity compared to east asian facebook users. the findings show marked cultural differences in the focus of attention among east asian and american facebook users. moreover, they echo previous research on cultural influences on visual perception ,attention, and reasoning in the offline world. "we believe these findings relate to a cultural bias to be more individualistic and independent in the us and more communal and interdependent in asia,,,said park. the research also found that cultural influences over our self-presentation online can shift over time and from place to place. in one of the study samples, americans studying in japan and japanese studying in the us both showed a tendency to adjust their profile photos to the general preferences of their host country. " facebook constitutes an extended social context in which personal profiles mirror various individual characteristics,</div><div>-0.3484965938695992 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.203125'>adjust</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>american</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>preferences</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>quickly</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

(a) the author had moved into a beautiful house (b) the author won't know the gentleman's name (c) the gentleman went to the hospital with the author (d) at last the gentleman caught his train on a particular monday morning i was standing waiting for the train and suddenly felt dizzy. i didn't eat much over the weekend because i moved into a new place and was very busy. it looked as if i had drunk too much wine, and suddenly the world began to sway and then went black. all i heard was "oh my god, she's falling." the next thing i remembered was that the emt was asking me my name. i was taken to the hospital by an ambulance. it turned out that i was too tired. the emt came to check on me before i left. he told me that a gentleman at the station waiting for the train saw me fall on the track when the train was coming in. he immediately got to my side and made sure that everyone kept back. he got the conductor's attention and the train stopped, and told others in the station to call 911. i was told that he stayed with me until the ambulance arrived. i asked the emt if he had the gentleman's name or address but he said no, he said the gentleman left the hospital without a word. i don't know who this gentleman is but if he reads this article and remembers a young lady fainting at the train station, i'd like him to get in touch with me and i will say "thank you" to him to his face. whenever i meet with such a thing i will do the same as he did for me and i'll pass on the kindness to others.</div><div>-0.34612588701526015 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>author</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.03125'>won</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.09375'>'</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>t</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>know</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>gentleman</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'>'</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>s</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>name</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

(a) too stupid to be a nurse (b) a dream too high to achieve (c) never too late to 1earn (d) a chance too important to miss by the time i reached junior high,i was sure i wanted to be a nurse. if you didn't study latin,you couldn't be a nurse,so i enrolled. many latin words were familiar to me. the hard part turned out to be the usage and creating sentences with the words that seemed so easy to pronounce. several weeks into the course my teacher came to me,saying,"i think you should withdraw from this course. it seems to be too hard for you. " that was the day i learned i wasn't smart enough to become a nurse. with shame. i handed in my latin textbook. after high school,the years raced by. i married and had children. then one day my husband john came home. "carol. max died this afternoon.

<div><div>what is the author's attitude towards people's panic? (a) objective. (b) supportive. (c) doubtful. (d) understandable. the deadliest ebola outbreak in history that has so far killed almost 1000 people in guinea, liberia, sierra leone and nigeria in west africa has caused fear around the world. the outbreak is unprecedented both in infection numbers and in geographic scope. officials from the world health organization (who) said earlier this month the outbreak "is moving faster than our efforts to control it", reported cnn. so far, the battle against the virus doesn't appear to be slowing down. the ebola virus is terrifying no matter where it strikes: it's a disease with no cure that causes headaches and fever, severe diarrhea , vomiting and bleeding and has been known to kill up to 90 percent of its victims. it is understandable for people to be panicked, but those living outside africa shouldn't be particularly concerned about contracting the virus, says awashington postarticle. this is because transmission of ebola requires direct contact with an infected person's blood, vomit or other bodily fluids during the period that he or she is contagious . it is something that is extremely unlikely for anyone but healthcare workers. the virus is not spread by coughing or sneezing. media outlets in the us and the uk are using terrifying headlines, wrongly claiming that people infected with the virus have traveled to their countries. james ball atthe guardiansays the ebola outbreak in africa is tragic, but it is important to _ other infectious diseases, including common influenza, are far, far deadlier.</div><div>-0.33709873345390673 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.070312'>objective</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

(d) when one is lying down. do you realize that every time you take a step, the bones in your hip are subjected to forces between four and five times your body weight? when you are running, this force is increased further still. what happens if through disease a hip-joint ceases to be able to resist such forces? for many years hip-joints and other body joints have been replaceable either partially or completely. it is after all a simple ball and socket joint; it has certain loads imposed on it; it needs reliability over a defined life; it must contain materials suitable for the working environment. any engineer will recognize these as characteristic of a typical engineering problem, which doctors and engineers have worked together to solve, in order to bring a fresh lease of life to people who would otherwise be disabled. this typifies the way in which engineers work to help people and create a better quality of life. the fact that this country has the most efficient agricultural industry in the world is another good example. mechanical engineers have worked with farmers and biologists to produce fertilizers, machinery and harvesting systems. this team effort has now produced crops uniformly waist high or less so that they are better suited to mechanical harvesting. similar advances with other crops have released people from hard and boring jobs for more creative work, whilst machines harvest crops more efficiently with less waste. providing more food for the rapidly increasing population is yet another role for the mechanical engineer.</div><div>-0.33630669976204963 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>when</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>one</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>is</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.1875'>walking</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>what is the main purpose of the author in writing the passage? (a) to describe what coral reefs are. (b) to tell people to protect coral reefs. (c) to introduce a film to people. (d) to ask people to visit coral reefs. filmmakers michele dive into an eerie world. the usually colorful corals are a ghostly white. most of the fish, crabs, and other animals have disappeared. the reef is sick and dying. coral reefs are often called "the rainforests of the sea" because of their abundance of life forms. a great diversity of animals finds food and shelter in every crack and crevice. today's reefs are about 10,000 years old. found in sunny, shallow water in warm seas all over the world, reefs are made up of the hard shells of millions of corals. as corals live and die, they create a giant, rocky honeycomb. only a thin top layer is living coral. a reef grows only about as fast as your fingernails--three-quarters of an inch a year. but coral reefs are huge, and in time a healthy reef can be thousands of miles long. millions of people around the world rely on reef fish and other animals for food. and reefs provide protection from storms at sea. without thousands of miles of reefs surrounding coastal areas, many beaches and even whole islands could be destroyed by the pounding of powerful ocean waves. "let's say a grazing animal like the parrot fish is overfished," michele explains. "without them, the kind of algae that the fish feed on could grow like weeds and take over the reef. the competition for space and sunlight could then starve the coral." nearly 27 percent of the world's coral reefs have been lost or damaged. but there is hope. many reefs around the world--including the great barrier reef in australia and the reefs off the florida keys in the united states--are now protected areas where scientists study how to keep reefs healthy. they determine how many and which kinds of fish can be taken for food without hurting the reef's delicate balance. there is hope, too, that people will learn to be good partners to the reefs. "we want our film to inspire people to help coral reefs," says michele</div><div>-0.33624802174642177 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'>introduce</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>film</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>people</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

(c) i think i am very great (d) i am the best student in our class. as young students, you have many dreams. these dreams can be very big, such as winning the nobel prize; they can also be small, such as becoming one of the best students in your class. once you find a dream, what do you do with it? do you ever try to make your dream real? follow your heart by andrew matthews, an australian writer, tells us that making our dreams real is life's biggest challenge. you may think you're not very good at some school subjects, or that it is impossible for you to become a writer. those kinds of ideas stop you from realizing your dream, the books says. in fact, everyone can realize his dream. the first thing you must do is to remember what your dream is. don't let it leave your heart. keep telling yourself what you want every day and then your dream will come true faster. you should know that a big dream is, in fact, made up of many small dreams. you must also never give up your dream. there will be difficulties on the road to your dreams. but the biggest difficulty comes from yourself. you need to decide what is the most important. studying instead of watching tv will help you to get better exam results, while saving five yuan instead of buying an ice cream means you can buy a new book. as you get closer to your dream, it may change a little. this is good as you have the chance to learn something more useful and find new hobbies.</div><div>-0.3327373403235634 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>i</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>can</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'>'</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>t</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>be</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>writer</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>
<div><div>while making tremendous achievements at college, asian-american students _ . (a) feel they are mistreated because of limited knowledge of english (b) are afraid that their academic successes bear a strong asian character (c) still worry about unfair treatment in society (d) generally feel it a shame to have to depend on their parents in only two decades asian americans have become the fastest growing u. s. minority. as their children began moving up through the nation schools, it became clear that a new class of academic achievers was emerging. their achievements are reflected in the nation's best universities, where mathematics, science and engineering departments have taken on a decidedly asian character. this special liking for mathematics and science is partly explained by the fact that asian-american students who began their education abroad arrived in the u. s. with a solid grounding in mathematics but little or no knowledge of english. they are also influenced by the promise of a good job after college. asians feel there will be less unfair treatment in areas like mathematics and science because they will be judged more objectively. and the return on the investment in education is more immediate in something like engineering than with an arts degree. most asian-american students owe their success to the influence of parents who are determined that their children take full advantage of what the american educational system has to offer. an effective measure of parental attention is homework. asian parents spend more time with their children than american parents do, and it helps. many researchers also believe there is something in asian culture that breeds success, such as ideals that stress family values and emphasize education. both explanations for academic success worry asian americans because of fears that they feed a typical racial image. many can remember when chinese, japanese and filipino immigrants were the victims of social isolation. indeed, it was not until 1952 that laws were laid down giving all asian immigrants the right to citizenship.</div><div>-0.33256368508566614 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'>are</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>afraid</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>that</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>their</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>academic</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>successes</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>bear</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>strong</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>sian</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>character</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"well, we'll be there for you, either way" his mother said. tim took an apple and walked to the bus. since the race was after school today (school was letting out at 3:00 today, instead of 3:15), he knew he would be too nervous to think about anything else until it began. he didn't even bring his new book with him, an action book starring an orphan named simon that tim sometimes pretended to be. 3:30 arrived and the race was about to begin. all the other students had brought running shorts, but tim was going to have to run in his school pants. suddenly, he saw that his shoes were untied. as he bent down to tie them, one of the older boys kicked the back of his knee, making him fall down right as the race began. by the time he got up and tied his shoes, he saw he would finish in last place, as the other kids were much farther ahead of him. it was almost 4:00 before tim saw the end of the run. by the time tim reached the finish line, the group of parents waiting on their kids was very small, as some kids had been finished for a long time. tim's father asked, "what took you so long? </div><div>-0.3322083326054701 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'>nothing</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>
<div><div>how many more times can a lifter try if he/she fails for the first time? (a) one. (b) two. (c) three. (d) four. in the competition of olympic weightlifting,the athletes try to lift the maximum weight they can. there are special conditions they have to meet in order to compete:body weight,height and strength. the olympic weightlifting mainly tests the limit of explosive strength .there are not many lifters who really like olympic weightlifting and the explanation is very simple:they are short of explosive strength. the weights used for olympic weightlifting are added in kilograms. the order by which the athletes enter the competition is not general,but it is set depending on the event. usually the athlete with the lowest weight begins. if he/she is not successful,he/she can try later. there is a maximum of three lifts allowed for every competition. for many years olympic weightlifting was only for men. however,now women also take part in olympic weightlifting. it was at the beginning of the 21st century that women's competitions entered an organized professional environment. for women,olympic weightlifting is more difficult because of their different body structure. however,strength training techniques are widely and successfully used by women,too. lots of the athletes who've ended up in olympic weightlifting competitions have started with strength training only to improve their muscle condition and their body power. however,the demarcation line is not still very clear between power training and olympic weightlifting. this is how so many lifters have got into olympic weightlifting competition,even if their purpose was different at the beginning.</div><div>-0.33179735663128995 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'>three</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>
<div><div>what is the passage mainly about? (a) dropout problem in america. (b) national concern over high schools. (c) workforce shortage in america. (d) high school dropout problem. articles in magazines and newspapers and special reports on radio and television reflect the concern of many americans about the increasing dropout rate in our junior and senior high schools.coupled with this fact is the warning that soon we will no longer have workforce to fill the many jobs that require properly-educated personnel. the highest student dropout rate is not a recent development.ten years ago, many urban schools were reporting dropout rates between 35 and 50 percent.some administrators believe that dropout remains the single greatest problem in their schools. consequently, much effort has been spent on identifying students with problems in order to give them more attention before they become failures.since the dropout problem doesn't only start in senior high school, special programs in junior high school focus on students who show promise but have a record of truancy, that is, staying away from school without permission.under the guidance of counselors , these students are placed in classes with teachers who have had success in working with similar young people.ways to motivate students in high school include rewarding academic excellence by electing scholars of the month, or by giving out clothing, such as school letter jackets formally given only to athletes.no one working with these students claims to know how to keep all students in school.counselors, teachers, and administrators are in the frontlines of what seems at times to be a losing battle.actually, this problem should be everyone's concern, since uneducated, unemployed citizens affect us all.</div><div>-0.3316116594719779 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.1875'>high</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>school</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>drop</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>out</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>problem</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

(d) agricultural scientists with green thumbs started the green revolution. green is an important color in nature. it is the color of grass and the leaves on trees. it is the color of most growing plants, too. sometimes, the word green means young, fresh and growing. sometimes, it describes something that is not yet finished or plants that are not for example, a greenhorn is someone who has no experience, who is new to a situation. in the fifteenth century, a greenhorn was a young cow or ox whose horns had not yet developed. a century or so later, a greenhorn was a soldier who had not yet had any experience in war . by the eighteenth century, a greenhorn had the meaning it has today--a person who is new in a job. about one hundred years ago, greenhorn was a popular expression in the american west. old-timers used it to describe a man who had just arrived from one of the big cities in the east. the greenhorn didn't have the skills that he would need to live in the hard, rough country. someone who has the ability to grow plants well is said to have a green thumb. the expression comes from the early nineteen hundreds. a person with a green thumb seems to have a magic touch that makes plants grow quickly and well. you might say that the woman next door has a green thumb if her garden continues to grow long after your plants have died. the green revolution is the name which was given some years ago to the development of new kinds of rice and other grains. the new plants produced much larger crops. the green revolution was the result of hard work by agricultural scientists who had green thumbs.</div><div>-0.328625712279351 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.109375'>agricultural</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>scientists</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>with</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>green</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>thumb</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>s</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>started</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>green</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>revolution</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>who was it that told the author ed had been found ? (a) the nurse. (b) the doctor. (c) the police.

<div><div>what's the purpose of mentioning abraham shakespeare? (a) attracting readers' attention. (b) describing a social phenomenon. (c) supporting the author's viewpoint. (d) making the news known to readers. if you win the $1.5 billion powerball jackpot , you may not be as lucky as you think. many winners experience the so-called curse of the lottery, with some squandering their fortunes and others meeting tragic ends. "so many of them wind up unhappy or wind up broke. people have had terrible things happen," said don mcnay, 56, a financial consultant to lottery winners and the author of life lessons from the lottery. "people commit suicide. people run through their money. easy comes, easy goes. they go through divorce or people die." "it's just a great change that they're not ready for," mcnay told time on tuesday. "it's the curse of the lottery because it made their lives worse instead of improving them." about 70 percent of people who suddenly receive a windfall of cash will lose it within a few years, according to the national endowment for financial education. here are some of the stories of past winners that gamblers should know about: abraham shakespeare was murdered in 2009 after he won a $30 million lottery jackpot. the 47-year-old florida man was shot twice in the chest and then buried under a slab of concrete in a backyard, abc news reported. dorris "dee dee" moore, who authorities say befriended him after his lottery win, was found guilty of first degree murder in 2012. his brother, robert brown, told the bbc that shakespeare always said he regretted winning the lottery. "'i'd have been better off going broke.' he said that to me all the time," brown said.</div><div>-0.32747867766713223 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.15625'>making</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>news</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>known</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>readers</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

(b) a great book can be read without any effort. (c) great books are never out of date. (d) great books will not disappoint you if you try to read them well. no matter how long your life is, you will, at best, be able to read only a few books of all that have been written, and the few you do read should include the best. it is to be expected that the selections will change with the times. yet there is a surprising uniformity in the lists which represent the best choices of any period. what are the signs by which we may recognize a great book? the four i will mention may not be all there are, but they are the ones i've found most useful in explaining my choices over the years. great books are probably the most widely read. they are not best sellers for a year or two. they are enduring best sellers. gone with the wind has had relatively few readers compared to the plays of shakespeare or donquixote. it would be reasonable to estimate that homer iliad has been read by at least 25,000,000 people in the last 3000 years. great books are popular, not pedantic . they are not written by specialists about specialties for specialists. whether they are philosophy or science, or history or poetry, they treat of human, not academic problems. they are written for men, not professors. to read a textbook for advanced students, you have to read an elementary textbook first. but the great books can be considered elementary in the sense that they treat the elements of any subject matter. they are not related to one another as a series of textbooks, graded in difficulty or in the technicality of the problems with which they deal. great books are always contemporary, the most readable and instructive. great books deal with the persistently unsolved problems of human life. there are genuine mysteries in the world that mark the limits of human knowing and thinking. great minds acknowledge mysteries honestly. wisdom is fortified , not destroyed, by understanding its limitations.</div><div>-0.32617844005842334 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>great</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>book</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>can</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>be</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>read</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>without</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>any</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>effort</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>how many us tv series are mentioned in this passage? (a) one. (b) two. (c) three. (d) four. fans of us television dramas watch their favorite series for different reasons: some want to improve their english skills, others just want to kill time.www.ks5u.com some tv series are more than pure entertainment--they have a certain depth. mad men, which returned with a sixth season recently; monday mornings, which just finished its first season; and modern family, which sweeps the awards every year, are just a few examples. why do these shows stand out among so many similar ones? tv critics raymond zhou will give you an idea of why some shows are better than others. period drama--more than time travel period dramas are intended to capture the ambience of a particular era. directors must therefore attract audiences as much by their recreation of a historical setting as by an interesting storyline.www.ks5u.com mad men is an excellent example of this balance being struck. set in new york during the 1960s, it accurately shows us attitudes in the workplace through the alcoholism and chain-smoking common of the time, and places an absorbing plot right in its center. but rather than merely presenting a past decade, mad men's subtle description of the struggles of white-collar workers at the time, both male and female, makes it stand out. "the series' attention to detail is superb," raymond zhou said. "for example, creator matthew weiner makes don draper--the leading role of the series--drive a buick instead of a cadillac, because weiner thinks the ad man lacks the self-pride to buy a luxury car. it's this kind of attentiveness that raises the show's artistic value." critics also recommend another period drama that works is broadwalk empire, set during the prohibition period of the 1920s and 1930s in atlantic city, new jersey. heather havrilesky at salon magazine noted how the show "revels in the oddities of its time, peeling back the layers of polite society to reveal a shadow world of criminals and politicians working together to keep the liquor flowing."www.ks5u</div><div>-0.3260110038732851 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.1875'>three</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>according to the writer,how can we deal with spam? (a) look out for any spam that reaches your computer . (b) don't trust any information on the internet. (c) but the cheaper products advertised in the spam. (d) don't buy anything advertised in the spams. you may open your electronic mail and find information about how to buy medicine,cheap airline tickets , and books and,of course,computers and computer products.there may also be offers for investment deals,bank loans and special holidays.however, to many computer users,this use of electronic spam to sell products has become a major problem as it makes computer communication more difficult. many companies who want to send a great deal of advertising might use the services of a " spammer." a spammer is a person or company that uses computers to send out millions of copies of the same sales information.spammers find e-mail addresses from websites,news groups and " chat rooms " where people send messages to each other. most spam is sent by companies who are trying to get you to buy their products . some of these are honest companies that offer good products or services for fair prices.these companies can offer their products for a cheaper price than you might find in a store.however, much of the spam on the internet is sent by criminals who are trying to sell products that do not exist or offer services they will not provide.they are only interested in stealing your money.when you answer their spam,you find you are expected to send them money and receive a gift.if you just follow what they ask you to do without any consideration, it is likely that you will be cheated and lose some money.</div><div>-0.3243347734976585 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'>don</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>'</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>t</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>buy</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>anything</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>advertised</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>in</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>spam</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>s</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>which of the following can be inferred from the text? (a) there are fewer foreigners in beijing than in shanghai. (b) it is the foreigners who make shanghai an international city. (c) many foreigners enjoy the traditional chinese festivals. (d) the foreigners came to shanghai to seek for money in the past. when we walk on a street or sit down to have a cup of coffee in a small cafe in shanghai, we will often see foreign faces at every turn. today, foreigners do not come to shanghai to seek adventures, as they did in the old days, or arrive in the city for a short visit, as some did when china just carried out the opening-up. instead, many foreigners come to shanghai to settle in the city. they are attracted by the life in shanghai and choose to stay in the city. their stay has made shanghai more like an international city. early in the 1990s, a group of western-style buildings _ at the gubei new district in the southwestern part of the hongqiao development zone in shanghai. the western-style buildings, marked by their great arches and the typical flavors of the unique european style, appealed to many foreigners and become their favorite choice when they came to live or work in shanghai. foreigners gathered in the zone, enjoying their quiet life there. as the city further develops, more and more foreigners choose to live in the downtown area where most native shanghai people live. they live close to local residents and gradually become interated into the local life--they learn to cook local dishes, they learn to speak the shanghai dialect and they celebrate traditional chinese holidays together with native people. their lifestyle is becoming more and more similar to that of local residents. in the past, foreigners that came to shanghai were mostly representatives sent to work in the city. today, however, many foreigners that live in the city are students, business starters or ordinary people. related information shows that there are more than 50,000 foreigners living and working in shanghai.</div><div>0.3207114047928322 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 86%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-2.625'>many</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>foreign</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>ers</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>enjoy</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>traditional</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>chi</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>nes</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>e</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>festivals</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"i know i am not very useful, but i can only do my best. i am happy that the gardener still finds a little bit of use in me, at least." one day, the gardener heard that kind of conversation. after watering the flowers as usual, he said, "you both have done your work very well. now i am going to carry you back. i want you to look carefully along the path." then the two buckets did so. all along the path, they noticed, on the side where the new bucket was carried, there was just bare earth; on the other side where the old bucket was carried, there was a joyous row of wild flowers, leading all the way to the garden.</div><div>-0.3180139630787351 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.1875'>show</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>off</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>its</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>beautiful</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>looks</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>purchase of experience can make people feel happier because _ (a) they increase the interaction between people (b) they are more economical than material goods (c) they are unique and can't be obtained again (d) they make the participant smarter ever since the global economic recession( ) began in 2008,many americans have changed their lifestyles by downsizing what they buy and what they possess. tammy strobel and her husband used to own a two-bedroom apartment,two cars and had good incomes. but tammy wasn't happy.inspired by a web site,they began donating some of their belongings to charity, and eventually got rid of their cars.some thought they were crazy,but now they feel much happier.without debt and working fewer hours,now they have more time to be outdoors and to volunteer. "the idea that you need to go bigger to be happy is false,"ms. strobel says. "i really believe that the acquisition of material goods doesn't bring about happiness." despite the fact that the economy is not as booming as it was,studies have shown that many are feeling happier as they save more and spend less.this mainly happens when they spend money on experiences instead of material objects and when they relish what they plan to buy long before they buy it. it is true that extra cash always makes life a little easier because it lets people meet basic needs.but scholars have found that types of purchases,their size and frequency,and even the timing of the spending all affect long-term happiness.one major finding is that spending money for an experience---concert tickets,french lessons, sushi-rolling classes---produces longer-lasting satisfaction. at the height of the recession in 2008,consumers were doing something different---vacationing in their yards, eating more dinners at home,organizing family game nights .as a result, these leisure activities appeared to make them less lonely and increased their interactions with others.

<div><div>what regulation was issued by new york state concerning beverage containers? (a) a fee should be charged on used containers for recycling. (b) throwaways should be collected by the state for recycling. (c) consumers had to pay for beverage containers and could get their money back on returning them. (d) beverage companies should be responsible for collecting and reusing discarded plastic soda bottles. in 1993, new york state ordered stores to charge money on beverage containers. within a year, consumers had returned millions of aluminum cans and glass and plastic bottles. plenty of companies were eager to accept the aluminum and glass as raw material for new products, but because few could figure out what to do with the plastic, much of it wound end up buried in landfills . the problem was not limited to new york. unfortunately, there were too few uses for second-hand plastic. today, one out of five plastic soda bottles is recycled in the united states. the reason for the change is that now there are dozens of companies across the country buying discarded plastic soda bottles and turning them into fence post, paint brushes, etc. as the new york experience shows, recycling involves more than simply separating valuable materials from the rest of the rubbish. a discard remains a discard until somebody figures out how to give it a second life -- and until economic arrangements exist to give that second life value. without enough markets to take in materials collected for recycling, throwaways actually reduce prices for used materials. fewer landfill space and rising costs for burying and burning rubbish are forcing local governments to look more closely at recycling. in many areas, the east coast especially, recycling is already the least expensive waste-management choice. for every ton of waste recycled, a city avoids paying for its disposal (,), which, in parts of new york, amounts to savings of more than $100 per ton. recycling also stimulates the local economy by creating jobs and reduces the pollution control and energy costs of industries that make recycled products by giving them a better raw material.</div><div>0.3159479721569014 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 89%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-2.1875'>consumers</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>had</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>pay</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>for</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>beverage</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>containers</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>and</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>could</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>get</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>their</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>money</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>back</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>on</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>returning</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>them</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>we can learn from the beginning of the passage that _ (a) the author lost his sight because of a car crash. (b) the author wouldn't love life if the disaster didn't happen.

<div><div>while you go rafting, you have to _ . (a) have rafting skills (b) know how to swim (c) wear leather shoes (d) put on a life jacket. why do people travel? well, many people travel because they want to see other countries and visit places that are famous, interesting or beautiful. people also travel to meet new friends, to try new kind of food, to experience life in other parts of the world or simply to get away from cold weather. yet there are other reasons why people travel. many of today's travelers are looking for an unusual experience and adventure travel is becoming more and more popular. here is a quick look at two popular activities: hiking and rafting. hiking hiking is a great way to travel. you will get close to nature and take exercise at the same time. hiking is easy to do and doesn't have to be very expensive. you can hike close to home or travel to other places. the basic equipment you need for hiking is simple: good shoes, clothes and a backpack. you can hike in the mountains, in a forest or along a river. you can also go for a hike in the city. hiking is fun and exciting, but you shouldn't forget safety. here are some basic tips for successful hiking: 1. don't hike alone. 2. tell someone where you are going; 3. bring water and a good map; 4. watch out for dangers, such as spiders, snakes, or poisonous plants; 5. wear a hat to protect yourself from the sun; 6.bring a mobile phone if you have one. rafting another exciting adventure is rafting. a raft is a small boat that you can use to paddle down rivers and streams. rafting is a good way to experience nature. if you want a normal rafting trip, choose a quiet stream or river that is wide and has few trees and other dangers. the name "whitewater" comes from the fact that the water in these streams and rivers looks white when it moves quickly. as with hiking, you should always think about your safety and wear good clothes. you also need to learn the basic skills of rafting, such as how to handle the raft, how to paddle and how to get in and out of the raft. you should not go rafting unless you know how to</div><div>-0.31432471185419064 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'>have</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>raft</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>ing</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>skills</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>from what adirienne said, we know that _ . (a) most of his classmates are interested in football (b) one can make many new friends in ecas (c) students get encouraged to join in ecas (d) half of his classmates are unwilling to join in ecas. to many students, high school is just a basic routine. you go to class in the morning, take a break for lunch and go home in the afternoon. this isn't quite that simple for pupils at royal west academy. as if classes and homework weren't already enough, students are also required to complete a range of extracurricular activities, or ecas. the range of ecas being offered at the school is various, including everything from guitar and jewelry-making clubs, fund-raising marches, to student committees, swimming and tennis. "i love ecas. i'm so happy we have them," said grade 11 student adrienne, who is a soccer player and member of the graduation committee. "they motivate the students, and they're a great bonding experience. i think that without them, not half as many students would be joining up for the soccer team." requiring students to complete ecas is a sign of the times. that's because young people are preparing for the future in ways that weren't considered necessary before. this is an era when ecas are seen as important. whether it's for leadership experience, sports, craft skills or volunteer these things are seen as rounding out the individual and improving their future. ecas can also help students discover their likes and dislikes. but as the old song says, you can't always get what you want, especially when so many students are all trying to sign up for the most popular activities. ecas can cut into study and homework time if you're not careful. you really have to get organized or you'll fall apart.</div><div>0.31422094648692467 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 86%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-2.59375'>one</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>can</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>make</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>many</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>new</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>friends</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>in</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>e</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>cas</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>gould and schipper are going to _ .

(d) no one understands why people speak against new buildings. should we allow modern buildings to- be built next to older buildings in a historic area of a city? in order to answer this question, we must first examine whether people really want to preserve the historic feel of an area. not all historical buildings are attractive. however, there may be other reasons for example, economic reasons-why they should be preserved. so, let us assume that historical buildings are both attractive and important to the majority of people. what should we do then if a new building is needed? in my view, new architectural styles can exist perfectly well alongside an older style. indeed, there are many examples in my own home town of tours where modern designs have been placed very successfully next to old buildings. as long as the building in question is pleasing and does not dominate its surroundings too much, it often improves the attractiveness of the area. it is true that there are examples of new buildings which have spoilt the area they are in, but the same can be said of some old buildings too. yet people still speak against new buildings in historic areas. i think this is simply because people are naturally conservative and do not like change. although we have to respect people's feelings as fellow users of the buildings, i believe that it is the duty of the architect and planner to _ . if we always reproduced what was there before,we would all still be living in caves . thus , i would argue against copying previous architectural styles and choose something fresh and different , even though that might be the more risky choice.</div><div>-0.31053011463746716 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.03125'>buildings</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>should</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>not</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>dominate</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>their</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>surroundings</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>what is the disadvantage of scolding the cheating students according to the passage? (a) they may continue to cheat next time. (b) they may be hurt mentally. (c) they may use other cheating tactics. (d) they may get on badly with their teachers. a student walks into his first class and realizes he forgot all about the midterm exam. he knows he needs to bring his grades up, and getting a zero will make it nearly impossible. he quickly jots down some notes and shoves them under his lap hoping it will help him pass. cheating is a major concern in all academic environments. students are creating new and more outrageous ways of cheating every day; some claim that certain accounts of cheating can be justified, but overall it can always be prevented. cheating has been around forever, and millions of ways to cheat have been fashioned. copying homework and cheat sheets are some of the most basic ways students in all education levels have cheated. some students think nothing about writing a few answers on their hand, in a gum wrapper, or boldly using a study guide to cheat. desperate students have even gone as far as to steal the test or scan in bottle wrappers and put answers into the nutrition label. the internet has now become available in almost every location. computers can be accessed at school, at home, and now even on cell phones. this opens a doorway for even more methods of cheating to be born. there are countless opinions on whether or not cheating can be justified. the truth is this behavior will always be a matter of opinion with each scenario of cheating. students often rationalize their cheating by claiming they forgot to look over the material or did not understand what the teacher or professor was saying. some may counter these arguments by saying that the student could have set reminders or asked the teacher to explain the material before the day of the test. some other reasons students believe cheating is justified are their heavy workloads and trying to find time for school, sports, friends, and family. this may be true in certain instances, however, all students have these problems, and it is unfair to the students refrain from cheating when the student who is dishonest receives a better grade. the majority of students who think cheating is acceptable may believe the reason for this is that sometimes students are unaware they are cheat</div><div>-0.30971741646118045 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>they</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>may</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.09375'>continue</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>cheat</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>next</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>time</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"dianhua"- telephone. after that, i begin hearing other words. sometimes, i would hear a couple of words in one sentence. more and more words began to stand out to me. i started studying chinese characters and began to be able to read small blocks of text in the advertisements. when i really began speaking in chinese to chinese people i met, i began to learn chinese fast and the smiles that i received in return were a fantastic reward for the work that i had done in learning the language. it was a great feeling</div><div>-0.30922503511802724 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>he</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.125'>has</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>been</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>rewarded</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>for</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>speaking</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>chi</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>nes</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>e</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"otherwise they had to travel all the way to macaoto do so." under the current law, gambling is prohibited all overchina, exceptmacao. "setting up the gambling network is the stupidest thing i've ever done," li said. "the whole thing started as a joke, but the joke went too far," he added. "i was not short of money, i was just being greedy." according to wu, the police uncovered the illegal network while investigating a local businessman, who fled without paying</div><div>0.3084482684132374 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 88%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-2.375'>being</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>greed</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>y</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>is</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>an</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>evil</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>sometimes</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>leading</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>crimes</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>what's the title for the passage? (a) how to study the earth. (b) the formation of the earth. (c) a hole in the earth. (d) studying the inside of the earth. it's a mystery that has puzzled scientists. five years ago, researchers found an area in the atlantic ocean seabed, where a part of the earth's outer layer, or crust , is missing. a thick layer of dark green rock, which is usually found deep inside the planet, lies exposed. the crust, mantle and core are the main layers that make up the planet. the mantle rests between the crust and the core. last month, a team of 12 british scientists set off on a six-week trip to study the hole in the crust. the hole is about 4,800 meters below sea level and is believed to be more than 48,000 meters long and more than 48,000 meters wide. scientists think that there are other nearby gaps. "it is like a window into the interior of the earth," says scientist bramley murton, who is part of the research team. the site where the hole is located is part of a ridge of undersea volcanoes. there, two of the plates that make up the earth's surface meet. the plates are always moving. when the plates move away from each other, lava rushes up from the mantle to fill the gap and form a new crust. but this did not happen in the area where the hole is located. the hole is giving researchers a good opportunity to study what's below the earth's surface. the team will use a special robotic tool to film the area and get samples of the exposed mantle. they hope to study everything from the chemistry of the oceans to how the earth's surface behaves under the sea.</div><div>-0.30756540317510794 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.0625'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>hole</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>in</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>earth</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>how many factors are mentioned which can account for the reason why fast food is slowly killing you? (a) seven. (b) three. (c) four. (d) five. eight in 10 americans eat fast food at least once a month and half eat it every week according, to a gallup poll. yet most people who eat fast food know it's bad for them. so why do they keep eating it? the answer is simple: the benefits of eating fast food outweigh the long-term implications for most people. however, once you read these reasons why all those trips to the drive through may be slowly killing you, you may just want to stop eating fast food after all. 1. fast food makes you fat. a 15-year study of over 3,000 people found that eating fast food is linked to weight gain and insulin resistance. in others words, fast food makes you fat and increases your risk of type 2 diabetes. you probably know this already. but here's something you may not know. 2. fast food is addictive. the more you eat fast food, the more you crave it. one study found that fast food is "a potentially addictive substance that is most likely to create dependence in vulnerable populations." if you eat fast food once a week or more, you may be addicted to it. 3. fast food is affecting your kids. according to the cdc, childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past 30 years. kids have an amazing ability to recall ads they've seen. fast food marketers know this, and design ads accordingly. research shows strong associations between increases in advertising for non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity. 4. fast food "burgers" don't have much burger in them. one study found that most fast food burgers are composed of about 50 percent water and the actual meat content is only 2.1 to 14.8 percent. so what makes up the rest of it, you ask? chemical fillers and preservatives, mostly. that's why we see read horror stories about burgers that don't go bad. 5. even "healthy" fast food isn't that healthy. fast food restaurants are catering to consumer demands to produce healthier options. the problem is, their definition of "healthy" is quite lax. one of the healthiest dishes at burger king, the</div><div>-0.3068643904601611 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.25'>five</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"i don't think i dare look at a really horrible and damaged body." agatha christie once said. but her pen dared travel where her eyes would not. in a 50-year writing career, christie's murder stories made her the world's best-known mystery writer. she is outsold only by the bible and shakespeare. her works have been turned into films and tv series, and a line of computer games is to be released over the next six years. "my grandmother liked to use new ways to reach people who wanted to enjoy her work," said christie's grandson, mathew pritchard. "turning her stories into pc games allows us to introduce classic mysteries to new audiences." born in 1890 in england, christie was educated at home and began her writing career while working as a nurse during world war i. she went on to produce 79 novels and numerous short stories, dying at the age of 86.

<div><div>in the virtual fitting room, what is on the screen? (a) a computer (b) a fitting room (c) a camera (d) a shop assistant have you ever wanted to try on clothes without going to the trouble of getting undressed? if you have, here's the device for you: the virtual fitting room. the technology, designed by russian company ar door, was first tried out in may. when a customer walks into a "fitting" room, they'll stand in front of a big screen that looks like a mirror. a camera in the mirror, using microsoft kinect, monitors a customer's movement and projects a 3-d image of the clothes onto you while you stand before a screen. the room also uses augmented reality technology. "augmented reality allows the customers to choose an item of clothing without having to try it on physically," the company told the daily mail. a customer can spin around to see all angles of the clothes, and can control the program by pushing virtual buttons. ar door is not the only company to be developing technology to help people with the way they look. japanese company shiseido recently presented its magic mirror, a virtual make-up mirror that allows people to get a full makeover in seconds. however, the technology is not perfect. the clothes still seem to hang on the surface of the body, rather than look like the customer is actually wearing them. and people shopping for clothes are probably still better off actually trying them on. in the end, you won't know how something really looks and feels.</div><div>-0.3064278780184724 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 98%, 100%); ' title='-0.3125'>fitting</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>room</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>
<div><div>what is the author's attitude toward people's problems in the passage? (a) matter - of - fact. (b) negative. (c) indifferent. (d) worried. a patient came to see me about the stress in her life. she described all the things she had to do -one was to make her bed-from the moment she woke up until she flew out of the door for work. i suggested she experiment by not making her bed for two weeks. she was shocked, probably thinking i'd been raised by wolves in a forest. however, she went along with my idea. two weeks later she went into my office beaming. she had left her bed unmade for the first time in 42 years-and nothing bad had happened. "and you know what?" she said. "i don't dry my dishes anymore, either." this woman had made two major breakthroughs . one was discovering that she had choices in her life that she had never seen before. the other was giving herself permission to be less that perfect. this story shows an important principle about managing time: no one can do it all. each of us has to make choices and accept trade - offs. the problem is, many people choose in ways that put themselves and their health last. they take better care of their houses and cars than they do of themselves. they put everyone else's needs ahead of their own. so what is the solution? there's an easy way. decide what you want in your life, and put that first. on a daily basis, that should include regular meals, enough sleep and time with your family. exercise, leisure, friendships and hobbies should also be regular aspects of life. the point is to do something for yourself every day. the choice is yours: whatever makes you feel good about yourself and your life. take a nap. take a walk. take time to play the piano. stop bringing your briefcase home from the office. stop keeping your house as clean as your mother kept hers. fill more of your time with want - to - dos instead of have - to - dos.</div><div>-0.3064201492477562 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.039062'>matter</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>-</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>of</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>-</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>fact</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>what is the best title for this passage? (a) how to make your dog exercise in cold weather (b) walk dogs in the cold weather (c) dogs like to take exercise in winter (d) take good care of dogs falling temperatures are no excuse to avoid outdoor exercise with your dog. along with making sure you are appropriately dressed, your dog should also be properly protected from the elements. some large breed dogs such as labrador retrievers, golden retrievers, german shepherds and huskies can tolerate the colder weather better than others. these dogs may also develop a thicker coat over time as they are exposed to colder weather. smaller breeds, however, like chihuahuas and miniature pinschers, breeds with short coats and puppies should wear some type of protection, i.e, a coat or sweater, if the temperature drops too low. look for coats or sweaters with high collars or a turtleneck that covers your dog from the base of the tail on top to the belly underneath. dog booties provide good protection from chemicals or salts on the pavement as well as mud. if you don't use the booties, be sure to wipe your dog's paw pads with room temperature water after taking it outside. other tips when you bathe your dog, dry him completely before taking him out in the cold weather for a walk or exercise. it is especially important to keep your dog well groomed during the winter months to protect him from the elements. if your dog frequently participates in outdoor activities during the colder months, increase his food intake, especially protein, to help keep his coat grow thick and healthy. dogs that are not as active during the winter months may need to have their food consumption reduced. the amount of time you spend outside with your dog will depend on his size, breed type and age. remember that ill or elderly dogs are more sensitive to cold weather. dogs whom cold weather agrees with can spend hours outside without getting cold but some of the smaller and younger dogs' exercise sessions should be kept shorter. dogs should not be left outside unattended. another activity to consider is doggie daycare, which is an excellent alternative during cold weather months. it's a great place for your dog to get plenty of physical and mental stimulation while being with other dogs. banfield pet hospital</div><div>-0.30579319490407275 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.03125'>walk</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>dogs</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>in</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>cold</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>weather</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"choosing healthier options, even for the short term, can lead to thinking about the influence of our decisions for a lifetime. " that5s the reason behind the "give it up for earth day" campaign. it9s designed to encourage healthy habits that benefit people and the planet it challenges everyone to help create a healthier world by making changes in their daily routine. " we wanted to plan an action-targeted campaign that will give people a chance to act  â m their concern for the environment in a positive way," said goldberg. the campaign has identified four daily actions that can add up to huge environmental saving. they include pledging to turn off the tv, give up the use of poisonous cleaners, reduce consumption of consumer products and cut out meat at the end of april, all. of the pledges will be recorded and converted into the number of tv hours not watched, dollars not spent on unnecessary items, electricity saved, greenhouse gas emissions avoided by cutting out meat, and poisonous chemicals produced from homes and landfills. " what we5re trying to achieve this year for earth day is to give people a chance to do something that is meaningful and measurable," said goldberg.</div><div>-0.3046184744174264 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.015625'>earth</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>day</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.03125'>canada</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>is</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>actually</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>an</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>everyday</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>environmental</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>action</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

"hey, did you guys hear that charles schulz died today?" he said casually - as if it were no big deal. then he took my sister's arm and they turned to head back to the reception hall. "coming?" they asked. "in a minute," i replied, and i sat back down on the bench, dizzy from what mike had just told me. how could charles schulz be dead? he was my creator! he was almost like a father to me! i had lost so many things on that day. my innocence had slipped away like a thief in the night. it was gone before i could do anything about it, taking with it all the treasures that i had held in my heart. i felt myself grow up in an instant.</div><div>0.3032331525281648 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-0.03125'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>author</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 89%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='-2.125'>is</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>no</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>longer</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>sad</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>and</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>ready</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>to</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>face</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>the</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>fact</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>that</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>she</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>is</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>an</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>adult</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); font-weight:bold' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>which of the following is not true? (a) bruce and edison were successful examples. (b) failure may be regarded as a way toward success.

(d) one may often raise a question whether his goals are worth attempting. in one way of thinking, failure is a part of life. in another way, failure may be a way towards success. the "spider story" is often told. robert bruce, leader of the scots in the 13th century, was hiding in a cave from the english. he watched a spider spinning a web . the spider tried to reach across a rough place in the rock. he tried six times without success. on the seventh time he _ and went on to spin his web. bruce is said to have taken heart and to have gone on to defeat the english... edison, the inventor of the light bulb, made hundreds of models that failed before he found the right way to make one. so what? first, always think about your failure. what caused it? were conditions right? were you in top from yourself? what can you change so things will go right next time? second, is the goal you're trying to reach the right one? try to do some thinking about what your real goals may be. think about his question, "if i do succeed in this, where will it get me?" this may help you prevent failure in things you shouldn't be doing anyway. the third thing to bear in mind about failure is that it's a part of life. learn to "live with yourself" even though you may have failed. remember, "you can't win them all."</div><div>-0.3021710848670127 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.03125'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.09375'>bru</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>ce</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>and</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>e</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>d</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>i</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>son</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>were</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>successful</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>examples</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>how long did it take mary to put his spectrograph into use? (a) three months. (b) half a year. (c) about a year. (d) several years. mary masterman hasn't decided where she will attend college, but when she does, she'll have plenty of money to pay for it. the 17-year-old took home a $100,000 scholarship tuesday as the top winner of the 2007 intel science talent search. "it was a complete surprise," said the senior at westmoore high school in oklahoma city, oklahoma. "i wasn't expecting it." masterman earned first place at this year's competition by building a low-budget spectrograph -- an instrument that identifies the unique characteristics, or "fingerprints," of different molecules. spectrographs are used in a variety of fields, including astronomy, medicine, and law enforcement. they can sense the presence of explosives or drugs, and they can also help determine the age of a piece of artwork. normally, the cost of a spectrograph can run as high as $100,000.mary, however, built her device--which she crafted from lenses, a laser, aluminum tubing, and a camera--for just $300."i wanted to build one that was lower-costing so it would be more available to anyone interested in spectrography," she said. sticking to a budget was only half the battle. getting the machine to work was another challenge. "i had to keep coming up with creative ways to adjust or change something," mary admitted. "it took three months to build and another three months before it actually functioned properly." mary competed with more than 1,700 other high school seniors in this year's science challenge. forty finalists were invited to washington, d.c., where they presented their projects at the national institute of science. in all, 10 students took home awards for their innovative projects.</div><div>-0.30206162410726145 <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='-0.03125'>about</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>a</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>year</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'>.</span> <span style='background-color:rgba(100%, 100%, 100%, 100%); ' title='0.0'></span></div></div><hr/>

<div><div>by mentioning the parrot fish, michel wants to tell us _ . (a) coral reefs need sunlight to survive (b) the biggest enemies of reefs are weeds (c) the parrot fish feed on a kind of algae (d) it is easy to destroy coral reefs filmmakers michele dive into an eerie world. the usually colorful corals are a ghostly white. most of the fish, crabs, and other animals have disappeared. the reef is sick and dying. coral reefs are often called "the rainforests of the sea" because of their abundance of life forms. a great diversity of animals finds food and shelter in every crack and crevice. today's reefs are about 10,000 years old. found in sunny, shallow water in warm seas all over the world, reefs are made up of the hard shells of millions of corals. as corals live and die, they create a giant, rocky honeycomb. only a thin top layer is living coral. a reef grows only about as fast as your fingernails--three-quarters of an inch a year. but coral reefs are huge, and in time a healthy reef can be thousands of miles long. millions of people around the world rely on reef fish and other animals for food. and reefs provide protection from storms at sea. without thousands of miles of reefs surrounding coastal areas, many beaches and even whole islands could be destroyed by the pounding of powerful ocean waves. "let's say a grazing animal like the parrot fish is overfished," michele explains. "without them, the kind of algae that the fish feed on could grow like weeds and take over the reef. the competition for space and sunlight could then starve the coral." nearly 27 percent of the world's coral reefs have been lost or damaged. but there is hope. many reefs around the world--including the great barrier reef in australia and the reefs off the florida keys in the united states--are now protected areas where scientists study how to keep reefs healthy. they determine how many and which kinds of fish can be taken for food without hurting the reef's delicate balance. there is hope, too, that people will learn to be good partners to the reefs.
